# current user of the processing pipelines and
# fly dirs to be selected for preprocessing and which tasks to run on them

# example configs below:


## Current user of the processing pipelines
# determines the scope used and the location of the data within the labserver
# as well as any other non-default parameters
# must match existing dictionary in 'run/userpaths.py'
# Examples: 

CURRENT_USER = USER_MA_2p2
CURRENT_USER = USER_JSP_scope

## Files to process and tasks
# General format:
# experiment_path/Fly#||trial1,trial2,trial3||task1,task2,task3

# Modifications:
#    instead of the full trial name, the begginning of the trial name is enough (usually the trial number)
#    'all' instead of the trial name will fetch all trials in the fly dir (unless excluded using e-)
#    k- before a trial indicates trial keyword (all trials with that keyword will be included, unless excluded using e-)
#    e- before a trial name (or start of name) indicates this trial will be excluded
#
#    ! before a task forces an overwrite.
#    p- before a task indicates pipeline (a preset set of tasks)

# Examples:

240621_T-17_MDN-GCaMP6f/Fly1||002,003,005||p-ablation
