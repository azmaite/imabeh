# user and fly dirs to be selected for preprocessing and which tasks to run on them
# example configs below.

# Current user - must match existing dictionary in 'run/userpaths.py'
# Example:
CURRENT_USER = USER_MA_2p2

# Files to process and tasks
# only give relative path within 'labserver_data' folder as found in 'run/userpaths.py'
# General format:
# experiment_path/Fly#||selected trials (a comma separated list of the beginning sequence of the trials without spaces)||task1,task2,!task3
# to run a pipeline of tasks (as defined in 'run/pipelines.py'), use the pipeline name starting with 'p_' (i.e. p_PipelineName)
# if a task/pipeline is to be run again even if it has previously been completed, place a '!' before the task name
